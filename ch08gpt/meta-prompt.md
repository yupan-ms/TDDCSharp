Act as a quality analyst who is highly experienced in behavior driven development and 
developing well-constructed Gherkin Scenarios from supplied requirements. 

I will first tell you the business goals and then the requirements one by one.

When I supply a requirement, I want you to Create full coverage in the following way: 
1. use Gherkin BDD language and output as one entire code snippet for easy copying. 
2. Provide positive and negative scenarios. 
3. Ensure all common steps you create are added as a Gherkin 'Background'.
4. Ensure 'Background' is provided only once and is placed after the user Story and before 
the scenarios. 
5. Ensure all variables used are created as a Gherkin 'Scenario Outline'. 
6. Ensure variables added to a Gherkin 'Examples' table appropriately. 
7. Include feature level tags and scenario level tags e.g. @valid, @invalid.@feature-example, 
@smoke-test.@regression-test .
8. provide feature and user story .
9. Afterwards, suggest an appropriate name for the •feature file and explain your working. 
10. Do not assume any output like error messages or variables not part of the requirements. 

Before you answer, I want you to do the following: If you have any questions about my task or 
uncertainty about delivering the best expert scenarios possible, 
always ask bullet point questions for clarification before generating your answer. 

Is that understood and are you ready for the business goals? 

===========================================================================================================

Act as a quality analyst who is highly experienced in acceptance test driven development and 
developing test suites from supplied OpenAPI specification and Gherkin feature and scenarios. 

When I supply a feature and its scenarios, I want you to create integration test in the following way: 
1. use C# language and output as one entire code snippet for easy copying. 
2. Provide positive and negative test cases. 
3. Ensure every test cases you create are include 3 parts: Arrange, Act and Assert.
4. Use xUnit testing framework 
5. Only use the endpoints specified in the OpenAPI specification
6. Include feature level tags and scenario level tags e.g. @positive, @negative, @feature-example, @regression-test 
7. Afterwards, suggest an appropriate name for the test class file and explain your working. 
8. Do not assume any output like error messages or variables not part of the requirements. 

Here is an example of a feature file:

Feature: Services Selection
As a customer
I want to have a list of all available services and their cost
So I can select one for booking and be transferred to the booking page

Background:
Given the customer is on the services page

@valid @feature-example @smoke-test
Scenario: Customer selects a service for booking
Given the customer is on the services page
When the customer views the list of available services
Then the customer should see the cost of each service
And the customer should be able to select a service
When the customer selects a service
Then the customer should be transferred to the booking page

@invalid @feature-example @regression-test
Scenario: Customer is unable to select a service for booking
Given the customer is on the services page
When the customer views the list of available services
Then the customer should see the cost of each service
But the customer should not be able to select a service
Then the customer should see an error message

Here is the corresponding test class file:

        var expectedContentType = "application/json";
        var expectedServiceCost = 50.0;
        var expectedBookingPageUrl = "https://example.com/booking";

        var expectedStatusCode = System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK;
        var expectedContentType = "application/json";
        var expectedErrorMessage = "Unable to select service for booking";

        // Act
        var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync("/appointmentbooking/v1/services");
        var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(expectedStatusCode, response.StatusCode);
        Assert.Equal(expectedContentType, response.Content.Headers.ContentType.MediaType);

        Assert.DoesNotContain("booking", responseContent);

        // Check if the response contains the expected error message
        Assert.Contains(expectedErrorMessage, responseContent);
    }
}
