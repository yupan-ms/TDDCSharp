Feature: Booking an appointment
  As a customer
  I want to book an appointment for a hairdressing service
  So that I can save time and avoid arranging appointments in person or on the phone

  @valid @default-options
  Scenario: Default options selected on booking page
    Given today is "2022-01-01"
    When I go to the booking page
    Then I should see the following default options selected:
      | Employee | Date       |
      | Any      | 2022-01-01 |
    And I should be able to select a service and book an appointment
