Feature: Appointment Days
As a business
We want to present the customer with a 7-day window max, including the current day, to pick an appointment
And we want to reduce this window if the selected employee is not fully available
So we can guarantee our employeesâ€™ availability for booking

Background:
Given the customer is on the booking page

Then the customer should see a 7-day window for appointment, including the current day

@valid @feature-example @regression-test

@invalid @feature-example @regression-test

When the customer views the available days for appointment
Then the customer should not see a 7-day window for appointment
