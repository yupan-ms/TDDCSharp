Feature: Default Options
As a customer
I want to have a booking page with [Any employee] and todayâ€™s date selected by default
So I spend less time clicking and finish booking faster

Background:
Given the customer is on the booking page

@valid @feature-example @smoke-test
Scenario: Customer sees default options on booking page
Then the customer should see [Any employee] selected by default
And the customer should see today's date selected by default

@invalid @feature-example @regression-test
Scenario: Customer does not see default options on booking page
Then the customer should not see [Any employee] selected by default
And the customer should not see today's date selected by default
Then the customer should see an error message

# The feature file can be named as "default_options.feature". The feature describes the ability of the customer to see the default options on the booking page.
