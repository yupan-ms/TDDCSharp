4. Ensure 'Background' is provided only once and is placed after the user Story and before 
the scenarios 
5. Ensure all variables used are created as a Gherkin 'Scenario Outline' 
6. Ensure variables added to a Gherkin 'Examples' table appropriately. 
7. Include feature level tags and scenario level tags e.g. @valid, @invalid.@feature-example, 
@smoke-test.@regression-test 
8. provide feature and user story 
9. Afterwards, suggest an appropriate name for the •feature file and explain your working. 
10. Do not assume any output like error messages or variables not part of the requirements. 

Before you answer, I want you to do the following: If you have any questions about my task or 
uncertainty about delivering the best expert scenarios possible,

# Business goals

In this day and age, most customers like to book an appointment online, especially since COVID-19, where shops tried to reduce the concentration of people in spaces via appointments.
Heads Up Barbers wants a booking solution that aims to do the following:
• Market the available hairdressing services.
• Allow a customer to book an appointment with a specific or a random barber.
• Give barbers a rest between appointments, usually 5 minutes.
• Barbers have various shifts in the shop and they are off work on different days, so the solution should take care of picking free slots based on the availability of barbers.
• Time saving by not having to arrange appointments on the phone or in person.

# Stories

## Story 1 – services selection
As a customer:
I want to have a list of all available services and their cost.
So I can select one for booking.
And be transferred to the booking page.

## Story 2 – default options
As a customer:
I want to have a booking page with [Any employee] and today’s date selected by default.
So I spend less time clicking and finish booking faster.

## Story 3 – select employee
As a customer:
I want to select any employee or a specific employee for my appointment.
So I can pick my favorite barber if I have one.

## Story 4 – appointment days
As a business:
We want to present the customer with a 7-day window max, including the current day, to pick an appointment.
And we want to reduce this window if the selected employee is not fully available.
So we can guarantee our employees’ availability for booking.

## Story 5 – time selection
As a business:
I want to present the customer with the time slots available for the selected employee for the selected date.
And take into consideration existing employee appointments and the employee’s shifts.
And round up any appointment to the nearest 5 minutes.
And take into consideration the rest time of 5 minutes between appointments.
So I ensure the customer is selecting an employee that is already available.

### Example 1 – no shifts are available
If an employee has no allocated shifts on the selected date, the list will be empty and the customer will be unable to book.

### Example 2 – no appointments are booked
An employee, Tom, has a shift on 2022-10-03 from 9:00 to 11:10 and has no booked appointments. The customer wants to book a 30-minute-long service. The selected start time will have the following values: 09:00, 09:05, 09:10, …, 10:35, and 10:40.

### Example 3 – multiple appointments booked at the end of the shift
An employee, Tom, has a shift on 2022-10-03 from 9:00 to 11:10, but he already has appointments booked from 09:35 to 11:10. The customer wants to book a 30-minute-long service. The selected start time will have the following value: 09:00. The following figure illustrates the time spans:

### Example 4 – multiple appointments booked at the end of the shift
Tom has a shift on 2022-10-03 from 9:00 to 11:10, but he already has appointments booked from 09:40 to 11:10. The customer wants to book a 30-minute-long service. The selected start time will have the following values: 09:00 and 09:05.

### Example 5 – an appointment booked in the middle of the shift
Tom has a shift on 2022-10-03 from 9:00 to 11:10, but he already has appointments booked from 09:40 to 10:35. The customer wants to book a 30-minute-long service. The selected start time will have the following values: 09:00, 09:05, and 10:40.

## Story 6 – name filling
As a customer:
I have to fill in my first and last name to act as my ID when I show up at the barber shop.
So I am uniquely identified.

## Story 7 – service display
As a customer:
I want a reminder of the name of the service that I picked, its price, and the required time.
So I can review my selection before hitting the Book button.

## Story 8 – all fields are mandatory validation
As a customer:
I have to select and fill in all fields before booking.
So I won’t get validation errors.

## Story 9 – random selection with any employee
As a business:
When [Any employee] is selected.
And more than one employee is free at the selected slot.
And I hit Book.
A free employee is selected randomly.
So I ensure our employees are allocated to appointments fairly.

### Example 1 – three employees are free at one slot
If the customer selects [Any employee] and gets three employees (Thomas, Jane, and William) who are free at 09:00, and the customer selects 09:00 and hits Book, Thomas, Jane, or William is allocated randomly to the appointment without taking into consideration any other factor, and one of them is selected.

## Story 10 – confirmation page
As a customer:
I want to see that my appointment is booked.
So I can rest assured that it is going ahead.
